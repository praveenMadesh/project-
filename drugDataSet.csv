Tretinoin topical,Acne,"Retin-A (tretinoin):			“Started this and I’m just hopeful as I cannot see any results yet.
Rather my acne has gotten terribly worse than it was . I’m still giving it time like they said",5,14-Nov-20,3
Tretinoin topical,Acne,"Retin-A (tretinoin):			“I have been on this for 5 months. I originally tried adapalene and broke into blisters and a rash and was hesitant to try another similar product. My derm said the retin-A was gentler and to start slow and do what I can tolerate. I used it every third day for two weeks and then every other day and continue every other day. I also use aczone but aczone was not effective on its own. My skin is almost completely clear. I don't even use it daily and have not felt this good in a while. I am so happy and can only imagine I will continue to see results. Consistency is key. Best acne product I have ever tried! Finally something that works.",10,5-Oct-20,6
Tretinoin topical,Acne,"Stieva-A (tretinoin):			“This cream is absolutely awful!!! Just a thin covering made my the skin on my whole face peel off more than 6 times and it’s still doing it one week later!!!",1,24-Aug-20,8
Tretinoin topical,Acne,"Retin-A (tretinoin):			“33 yo/female. Had acne since I was 13 yo. Was diagnosed with PCOS. Took birth control for about 15 years also Spironolactone. My acne is very persistent and mainly comedonal especially jaw line/cheeks/upper neck. I stopped birth control and was tired of Spironolactone as taken alone it didn't do much for me. Went on Accutane which was a horrible experience to clear my acne for it to come back just 6 months later. Have been using Retin A 0.01% for 2.5 months and I can see a lot of improvement. My skin is still purging as it's really congested but I can see it's improving gradually and clearing up. It was a real mess in the first 6 weeks. I'm getting less painful acne around my jaw area now and my skin is much softer, the scars are also fading. Will continue the treatment for the rest of my life I believe. Highly recommend it to anyone with hormonal acne who doesn't want to take medication.",10,21-Aug-20,26
Tretinoin topical,Acne,"Retin-A (tretinoin):			“Retin A..wow is all I can say. This product is amazing. I had small stubborn little bumps (clogged pores) and just overall comedonal acne. Retin A has completely cleared my skin and made it look even better than it did before I had acne. My skin so smooth and it just continues to boost my skin confidence. I've been on Retin A for about a year and hse “Retin A micro pump gel 0.06%”.  I did purge a lot and had SLIGHT dryness/irration in the beginning but I didn’t mind it because I WANTED to get rid of the small bumps that were clogged pores. MY TOP ADVICE about this product is using it consistently! This product works slowly (but effectively) and will take some time to produce the wonderful results. Also, I still get a pimple occasionally but no where near what I had. The pimple will usually come and go quickly with this product. I use a mosturizer and a good SPF sunscreen. This is the BEST so stick it out during the purging phase because it is WORTH IT.",10,1-Aug-20,21

Tretinoin topical,Acne,So I read the reviews and most were bad but I also read good ones. I decided to give tretinoin  a chance and I can honestly say that this tretinoin cream is not for me. I had a severe allergic reaction around my lips and nose . And I have been purging like crazy. When I started this I only had like 3 pimples and smaller ones and hyperpigmentation. I thought maybe the allergic reaction will go away and it has not it burns a lot and I'm seeing my dermatologist on Tuesday and hopefully I get something better but this is just my personal experience it may have not worked for me but it can work for you,1,14-Jun-20,9
Tretinoin topical,Acne,"The first few weeks you feel like giving up. Made my skin look very shiny in a weird way, peeling was hard to cover and the initial purge sucked. That said, like everyone has mentioned on here, it gets better. The purge is cleaning you out, so keep this perspective. I did not feel good about my skin during that time, but so glad I stuck with it. I'm now at week 9 and have 3-4 pimples on my face, skin is super smooth and looks really glowy. Every day keeps getting better. I'm still peeling on and off but its less than it used to be.  Just ease in slowly so you don't get crazy red or peely. I did about 2-3 a week to start and now at 4x a week. Love that this gets rid of hyperpigmentation quickly.",9,4-Jun-20,22
Tretinoin topical,Acne,"I started tretinoin 0.025 about a week ago for moderate teenage acne. So far, no new breakouts. Face is peeling but not super dry if you know what I mean.

Tretinoin topical,Acne,"Retin-A (tretinoin):			“prior to using this cream, I checked reviews. I saw a lot of negatives; people complaining about a face-purge. I was highly discouraged. After a while, I said screw it. I’ve been struggling with acne for a long time now. I’m a 22 year old african male, been struggling with acne since I was 11; that is half of my life. I ignored the negatives and decided to give it a shot. Week 1 and 2 were calm. The purge started on week 3 and it was  horrible! I couldn’t leave my house, my face was a mess. I was nearly compelled to quit but I persevered.  The purge lasted through till week 8. On the 9th week, I noticed little less break outs. I’m on my 11 week now and man! my face is as smooth as a baby’s. I honestly can’t believe this. This is the best my face has been in more than a decade. I'd highly recommend. The purge period is absolutely hectic and discouraging but do not give up. stick to it I promise. advice: Take pictures to track your progress",9,29-Apr-20,61

Then my doctor prescribed me Stieva-A and after about a month my skin instantly cleared up, I couldn’t believe it actually worked for me. It’s even helped to slowly fade my acne scars, my face hasn’t felt this smooth in a while, also a bonus is when I apply makeup now, it’s sooooo smooth. I just got a second refill on this product because I love it so much and want to use it for a year and see how much it can help my scars fade. Also a little bit goes along way which is nice !",8,24-Apr-20,13
Tretinoin topical,Acne,"Retin-A (tretinoin):			“When I was 5 weeks into using this topical Retin-A I headed to the internet to figure out why my acne was 5 times WORSE than when I started it. I would honesty just look in the mirror and cry, I picked at all my pimples and it made it even worse. The purge is real but If you can make it past it I promise it’s worth it. Do some research on why the purge happens. I am 10 weeks in and all that I have on my face is scaring due to the picking which will go away over time and with the help of other topicals. My advice is to stick with it, do not pick and trust the process!",8,22-Apr-20,24
Tretinoin topical,Acne,"Retin-A (tretinoin):			“I have acne-prone skin and started having acne 12-ish. I have done extensively research on effective medication and found Retin-A. I introduced RetinA to my skin, really slowly by applying for 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120min and washing it off before my normal routine for 1week each (2min for 1week, 5min for 1week & go on). Then I started apply it overnight as my last step (moisturizer 30min then RetinA 0.025) from 1night/week to every other night then every night. I am on my 8th week of using RetinA every night as my last step. I am going to use it before moisturizer in week10. Gradually introduce RetinA to my skin made the purging bearable (slowly purging) and subsided those side effects. I still have red scars but much smoother texture, little bumpy. I am still breaking out but expecting. Complexion is improving. Skin is brighten and glowing. Skin is more balance, not oily, not dry. I am on month2 and happy with my skin, not perfect, much better. RetinA is worth your patience.",10,17-Apr-20,14

If any area was super irritated I put aquafor on it was healed over night. The first 2-5 weeks my skin broke out worse than before I started using, however the pimples were smaller than usual and would clear up quickly. Weeks 6-7 my skin looked like it was finally clearing up with the exception of two stubborn areas. Those areas didn’t improve in this time but didn’t get worse. Weeks 8-10 my the two problem areas cleared up almost completely but unfortunately I was left with hyperpigmentation. I had minor breakouts on my chin. Weeks 10-12 breakouts stopped. No more purging. Skin clear with the exception of blackheads on nose and chin. Weeks 13-16 still have the blackheads although they seem to be dissipating. Skin texture feels AWESOME.

After about a month of use my skin was very irritated and I experienced a worsening of my acne. I continued to use and changed my skincare routine by using cetaphil to wash my face and cerave moisturizer spf 30 in the am and cerave pm at night. Also had to buy a foundation for normal/dry skin.

Tretinoin topical,Acne,"Retin-A (tretinoin):			“Okay, been on Retin A since early November. Prescribed by my primary care physician prior to seeing a dermatologist. When I first began, I started using the gel two times a week. Making sure to always wash off in the morning and use sunscreen throughout the day.  I was afraid of the purging period which THANK GOD, I never had. It almost felt like the medication wasn't working. I had no burning or stinging sensations just minor peeling which was not bad AT ALL. This could be because I am on the lowest dosage (0.025). I upped my usage to three times a week and keep using despite ""feeling like anything was working"". Fast forward to today, three months later and my skin is sooooooo smooth. I still have fading dark marks but they are significantly lighter. I have ZERO ACTIVE ACNE bumps. Smooth skin and very shiny. I am a 25 y/o African American female and THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT.
